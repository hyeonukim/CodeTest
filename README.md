# CodeTest

I had an issue with an OTclient (https://github.com/edubart/otclient/wiki/Compiling-on-Windows) that was given as animation was showing up weirdly

After some digging in the forum I found out that it could be a possibility of the client problem so I used this client https://otland.net/threads/issue-on-the-animation-of-eternal-winter.281595/ I did not push the files for it as it became a submodule.
